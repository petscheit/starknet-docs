## Installation Issues

### Starkup installation fails

**Problem:** The Starkup installer fails or hangs during installation.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have a stable internet connection
2. Try running the installer with verbose output:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.starkup.sh | sh -s -- --verbose
   ```
3. If the issue persists, try the [manual installation method](/build/quickstart/environment-setup#manual-installation-alternative)

### Commands not found after installation

**Problem:** `scarb`, `snforge`, `sncast`, or `starknet-devnet` commands are not recognized.

**Solutions:**
1. Restart your terminal completely
2. Source your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # On Linux
   source ~/.zshrc   # On macOS (if using zsh)
   ```
3. Check if the tools are installed:
   ```bash
   asdf list scarb
   asdf list starknet-foundry
   asdf list starknet-devnet
   ```
4. If tools are listed but still not found, try:
   ```bash
   asdf reshim
   ```

### Permission denied errors

**Problem:** Getting permission denied errors during installation.

**Solutions:**
1. Don't use `sudo` with asdf or Starkup installations
2. Ensure your user has write permissions to the home directory
3. On macOS, you might need to install Xcode command line tools:
   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

## Development Issues

### Scarb project creation fails

**Problem:** `scarb new` command fails or creates incomplete projects.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Scarb installation:
   ```bash
   scarb --version
   ```
2. Ensure you're in a directory where you have write permissions
3. Try creating the project with a different name (avoid special characters)

### Starknet Devnet won't start

**Problem:** `starknet-devnet` fails to start or crashes immediately.

**Solutions:**
1. Check if another instance is already running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep starknet-devnet
   ```
2. Kill any existing instances:
   ```bash
   pkill starknet-devnet
   ```
3. Try starting with different port:
   ```bash
   starknet-devnet --port 5051
   ```
4. Check system resources (ensure you have enough RAM and disk space)

### Contract compilation errors

**Problem:** `scarb build` fails with compilation errors.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure your Cairo syntax is correct
2. Check that all imports are properly specified
3. Verify you're using compatible versions of Scarb and Cairo
4. Clean and rebuild:
   ```bash
   scarb clean
   scarb build
   ```

### Deployment failures

**Problem:** Contract deployment fails with various errors.

**Solutions:**
1. **Insufficient funds:** Ensure your account has enough ETH for gas fees
2. **Network issues:** Check your internet connection and try again
3. **Invalid contract:** Ensure the contract compiles successfully before deployment
4. **Account issues:** Verify your account is properly configured and deployed

### Account creation issues

**Problem:** `sncast account create` or `sncast account deploy` fails.

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have sufficient funds for account deployment
2. Check network connectivity
3. Verify you're using the correct network (devnet vs testnet)
4. Try with a different account name

## Network-Specific Issues

### Sepolia testnet issues

**Problem:** Transactions fail on Sepolia testnet.

**Solutions:**
1. **Get testnet ETH:** Use the [Starknet Sepolia faucet](https://starknet-faucet.vercel.app/) to get test tokens
2. **Network congestion:** Wait and retry during off-peak hours
3. **Gas estimation:** Try increasing gas limits manually
4. **RPC issues:** Try using a different RPC endpoint

### Local devnet issues

**Problem:** Local devnet behaves unexpectedly.

**Solutions:**
1. Restart the devnet with fresh state:
   ```bash
   starknet-devnet --seed 0
   ```
2. Clear any cached data
3. Ensure no port conflicts with other services

## Version Compatibility Issues

### Tool version mismatches

**Problem:** Different tools report incompatible versions.

**Solutions:**
1. Update all tools to latest versions:
   ```bash
   asdf install scarb latest
   asdf install starknet-foundry latest
   asdf install starknet-devnet latest
   asdf global scarb latest
   asdf global starknet-foundry latest
   asdf global starknet-devnet latest
   ```
2. Check compatibility matrix in the [official documentation](https://docs.starknet.io)
