title: "core::circuit::CircuitDefinition"
---

A trait for defining a circuit's structure and behavior.
This trait is used to define the structure of a circuit, including its inputs,
gates, and outputs. It provides the foundation for circuit evaluation.
The `CES` type parameter represents a tuple of `CircuitElement`s that together
define the circuit's structure.



## Signature
