## [Modules](./core-internal-modules)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| [bounded_int](./core-internal-bounded_int) | — |

## [Structs](./core-internal-structs)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| [DropWith](./core-internal-DropWith) | Wrapper type to ensure that a type `T`  is dropped using a specific `Drop`  impl. |
| [InferDrop](./core-internal-InferDrop) | Helper to have the same interface as `DropWith`  while inferring the `Drop`  implementation. |
| [DestructWith](./core-internal-DestructWith) | Wrapper type to ensure that a type `T`  is destructed using a specific `Destruct`  impl. |
| [InferDestruct](./core-internal-InferDestruct) | Helper to have the same interface as `DestructWith`  while inferring the `Destruct` implementation. |

## [Enums](./core-internal-enums)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| [OptionRev](./core-internal-OptionRev) | Same as `Option` , except that the order of the variants is reversed. This is used as the return type of some libfuncs for efficiency reasons. |
| [LoopResult](./core-internal-LoopResult) | The return type for loops with an early return. |

## [Extern functions](./core-internal-extern_functions)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| [revoke_ap_tracking](./core-internal-revoke_ap_tracking) | — |
| [require_implicit](./core-internal-require_implicit) | Function to enforce that `Implicit`  is used by a function calling it. Note: This extern function is not mapped to a Sierra function, and all usages of it are removed during compilation. |
