title: "core::metaprogramming::TypeEqual"
---

A trait that can be used to disable implementations based on the types of the generic args.
Assumes that `TypeEqualImpl` is the only implementation of this trait.
Primarily used for optimizations by enabling type-specific implementations.
Since `TypeEqualImpl` is the only implementation, adding `-TypeEqual` as a trait
bound ensures the implementation is only available when T and U are different types.



## Signature

```rust
pub trait TypeEqual
```
