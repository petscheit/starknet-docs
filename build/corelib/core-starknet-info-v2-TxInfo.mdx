```


### signature

The signature of the transaction.

```rust
pub signature: Span
```


### transaction_hash

The hash of the transaction.


#### Signature

```rust
pub transaction_hash: felt252
```


### chain_id

The identifier of the chain.
This field can be used to prevent replay of testnet transactions on mainnet.


#### Signature

```rust
pub chain_id: felt252
```


### nonce

The transaction's nonce.


#### Signature

```rust
pub nonce: felt252
```


### resource_bounds

A span of `ResourceBounds` structs used for V3 transactions.


#### Signature

```rust
pub resource_bounds: Span
```


### tip

The tip of the transaction.


#### Signature

```rust
pub paymaster_data: Span
```


### nonce_data_availability_mode

The data availability mode for the nonce.
Used for V3 transactions.


#### Signature

```rust
pub nonce_data_availability_mode: u32
```


### fee_data_availability_mode

The data availability mode for the account balance from which fee will be taken.
