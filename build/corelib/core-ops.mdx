Overloadable operators.
Implementing these traits allows you to overload certain operators.
Note: Other overloadable operators are also defined in the [`core::traits`](./core-traits) module.
Only operators backed by traits can be overloaded. For
example, the addition assignment operator (`+=`) can be overloaded through the `AddAssign`
trait, but since the assignment operator (`=`) has no backing trait, there
is no way of overloading its semantics. Additionally, this module does not
provide any mechanism to create new operators.
Implementations of operator traits should be unsurprising in their
respective contexts, keeping in mind their usual meanings and
operator precedence. For example, when implementing `MulAssign`, the operation
should have some resemblance to multiplication assignment.
## Examples

This example creates a `Point` struct that implements `AddAssign` and `SubAssign`,
and then demonstrates adding and subtracting two `Point`s to themselves.
```rust
use core::ops::{AddAssign, SubAssign};

#[derive(Debug, Drop, Copy, PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl AddAssignImpl of AddAssign {
    fn add_assign(ref self: Point, rhs: Point) {
        self = Point { x: self.x + rhs.x, y: self.y + rhs.y }
    }
}

impl SubAssignImpl of SubAssign {
    fn sub_assign(ref self: Point, rhs: Point) {
        self = Point { x: self.x - rhs.x, y: self.y - rhs.y }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut point = Point {x : 3, y: 4};
    point += point;
    assert!(point == Point {x: 6, y: 8});
    point -= point;
    assert!(point == Point {x: 0, y: 0});
}
```

See the documentation for each trait for an example implementation.
