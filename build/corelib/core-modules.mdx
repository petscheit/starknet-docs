| [keccak](./core-keccak) | Keccak-256 cryptographic hash function implementation.... |
| [pedersen](./core-pedersen) | Pedersen hash related traits implementations. This module provides an implementation of the Pedersen hash function, which is a collision-resistant cryptographic hash function. The `HashState`... |
| [qm31](./core-qm31) | Definition for the `qm31`  type. Only available for local proofs. The implementations defined in this module can be accessed by using the traits directly. |
| [serde](./core-serde) | Serialization and deserialization of data structures. This module provides traits and implementations for converting Cairo types into a sequence of `felt252`... |
| [sha256](./core-sha256) | Implementation of the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function. This module provides functions to compute SHA-256 hashes of data. The input data can be an array of 32-bit words, or a `ByteArray` .... |
