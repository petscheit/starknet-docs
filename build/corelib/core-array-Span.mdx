title: "core::array::Span"

A span is a view into a contiguous collection of the same type - such as `Array`.
It is a structure with a single field that holds a snapshot of an array.
`Span` implements the `Copy` and the `Drop` traits.



## Signature

```rust
pub struct Span {
    pub(crate) snapshot: Array,
}
```
