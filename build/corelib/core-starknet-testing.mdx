Testing utilities for Starknet contracts.
This module provides functions for testing Starknet contracts. The functions
allow manipulation of blockchain state and storage variables during tests, as well as
inspection of emitted events and messages.
Note: The functions in this module can only be used with the `cairo-test` testing framework.
If you are using Starknet Foundry, refer to its
documentation.
