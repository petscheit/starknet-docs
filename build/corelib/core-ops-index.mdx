Indexing traits for indexing operations on collections.
This module provides traits for implementing the indexing operator `[]`, offering two distinct
approaches to access elements in collections:
- [`IndexView`](./core-ops-index-IndexView) - For snapshot-based access
- [`Index`](./core-ops-index-Index) - For reference-based access
# When to use which trait

- Use [`IndexView`](./core-ops-index-IndexView) when the collection can be accessed in a read-only context and is not
mutated by a read access. This is the most common case in Cairo.
- Use [`Index`](./core-ops-index-Index) when the input type needs to be passed as `ref`. This is mainly useful for types
depending on a [`Felt252Dict`](./core-dict-Felt252Dict), where dictionary accesses are modifying the data structure
itself.

Only one of these traits should be implemented for any given type, not both.
