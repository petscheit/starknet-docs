|:---|:---|
| [checked](./core-num-traits-ops-checked) | Safe arithmetic operations with overflow/underflow checking. This module provides traits for performing arithmetic operations with explicit overflow and underflow protection. These operations return... |
| [divrem](./core-num-traits-ops-divrem) | â€” |
| [overflowing](./core-num-traits-ops-overflowing) | Arithmetic operations with overflow detection. This module provides traits for performing arithmetic operations that explicitly track potential numeric overflow conditions. |
| [pow](./core-num-traits-ops-pow) | Trait and implementations for raising a value to a power. This module provides efficient exponentiation operations for numeric types using... |
| [saturating](./core-num-traits-ops-saturating) | Saturating arithmetic operations for numeric types. This module provides traits and implementations for arithmetic operations that saturate at the numeric type's boundaries instead of overflowing. |
| [wrapping](./core-num-traits-ops-wrapping) | Arithmetic operations with overflow and underflow wrapping. This module provides traits for performing arithmetic operations that wrap around at the... |
| [sqrt](./core-num-traits-ops-sqrt) | Square root operation for unsigned numeric types. |
| [widemul](./core-num-traits-ops-widemul) | Trait for performing multiplication that results in a wider type. This module provides the `WideMul`  trait which enables multiplication operations... |
| [widesquare](./core-num-traits-ops-widesquare) | Wide square operation. This module provides the `WideSquare`  trait which enables squaring operations that return a result type with double the bit width of the input type.... |
