title: "core::traits::DivRem"
---

Performs truncated division and remainder.
This trait provides a way to efficiently compute both the quotient and remainder in a single
operation. The division truncates towards zero, matching the behavior of the `/` and `%`
operators.

## Signature

```rust
pub trait DivRem
```



## Examples

```rust
assert!(DivRem::div_rem(7_u32, 3) == (2, 1));
```


## Trait functions

### div_rem



Performs the `/` and the `%` operations, returning both the quotient and remainder.

#### Signature

```rust
fn div_rem(lhs: T, rhs: NonZero) -> (T, T)
```




#### Examples

```rust
assert!(DivRem::div_rem(12_u32, 10) == (1, 2));
```
