title: "core::starknet::account::AccountContract"
---

A trait for account contracts that support class declarations (only `__validate__` and
`__execute__` are mandatory for an account).
This trait assumes that the calldata for invoke transactions is `Array`.
This is the network standard following SNIP6.
It is not enforced by Starknet, but deviating from the standard interface may lead to
incompatibility with standard tooling.



## Signature

```rust
pub trait AccountContract
```



## Trait functions

### __validate_declare__



An entry point that is called to check if the account is willing to pay for the declaration
of the class with the given hash.
The entry point should return `starknet::VALIDATED` if the account is willing to pay
for the declaration.





#### Signature

```rust
fn __validate_declare__(
    self: @TContractState, class_hash: felt252,
) -> felt252
```


### __validate__



An entry point that is called to check if the account is willing to pay for
executing a given set of calls.
The entry point should return `starknet::VALIDATED` if the account is willing to pay
for the execution, in which case `__execute__` will be called on the same set of calls.





#### Signature

```rust
fn __validate__(
    ref self: TContractState, calls: Array,
) -> felt252
```


### __execute__



An entry point that is called to execute a given set of calls.
This entry point should block the deprecated v0 invoke transactions as they do not go
through the `__validate__` entry point.





#### Signature

```rust
fn __execute__(
    ref self: TContractState, calls: Array,
) -> Array>
```
