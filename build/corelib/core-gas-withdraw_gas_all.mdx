title: "core::gas::withdraw_gas_all"
---

Same as `withdraw_gas`, but directly receives `BuiltinCosts`, which enables optimizations
by removing the need for repeated internal calls for fetching the table of constants that may
internally happen in calls to `withdraw_gas`.
Should be used with caution.



## Signature

```rust
pub extern fn withdraw_gas_all(costs: BuiltinCosts) -> Option implicits(RangeCheck, GasBuiltin) nopanic;
```
