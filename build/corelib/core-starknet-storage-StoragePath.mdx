title: "core::starknet::storage::StoragePath"
---

An intermediate struct to store a hash state, in order to be able to hash multiple values and
get the final address.
Storage path should have two interfaces, if `T` is storable then it should implement
`StorageAsPointer` in order to be able to get the address of the storage path. Otherwise, if
`T` is not storable then it should implement some kind of updating trait, e.g.
`StoragePathEntry`.



## Signature

```rust
pub struct StoragePath {
    __hash_state__: HashState,
}
```
