| [EcOp](./core-ec-EcOp) | â€” |
| [EcPoint](./core-ec-EcPoint) | A point on the STARK curve. Points can be created using `EcPointTrait::new`  or `EcPointTrait::new_from_x` . The zero point represents the point at infinity. |
| [EcState](./core-ec-EcState) | Elliptic curve state. Use this to perform multiple point operations efficiently. Initialize with `EcStateTrait::init` , add points with `EcStateTrait::add` or `EcStateTrait::add_mul`... |
