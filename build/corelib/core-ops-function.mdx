Function traits and types.
This module defines traits for function-like types that can be called.
The two main traits are:
- [`FnOnce`](./core-ops-function-FnOnce) - For single-use functions that consume their environment
- [`Fn`](./core-ops-function-Fn) - For reusable functions that can be called multiple times
## Examples

```rust
// Using Fn for a reusable operation
fn apply_twice, +core::ops::Fn[Output: u32]>(f: F, x: u32) -> u32 {
    f(f(x))
}

let double = |x| x * 2;
assert!(apply_twice(double, 2) == 8);
```

| | |
|:---|:---|
| [Fn](./core-ops-function-Fn) | The version of the call operator that takes a by-snapshot receiver. Instances of `Fn`  can be called repeatedly. `Fn`  is implemented automatically by closures whose captured variables are all `Copy`... |
| [FnOnce](./core-ops-function-FnOnce) | The version of the call operator that takes a by-value receiver. Instances of `FnOnce`  can be called, but might not be callable multiple... |
