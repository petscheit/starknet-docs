title: "core::byte_array::BYTE_ARRAY_MAGIC"
---

A magic constant for identifying serialization of `ByteArray` variables. An array of `felt252`
with this magic value as one of the `felt252` indicates that you should expect right after it a
serialized `ByteArray`. This is currently used mainly for prints and panics.
