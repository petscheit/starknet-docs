title: "core::starknet::storage::map::StoragePathEntry"
---

Computes storage paths for accessing [`Map`](./core-starknet-storage-map-Map) entries.
The storage path combines the variable's base path with the key's hash to create a unique
identifier for the storage slot. This path can then be used for subsequent read or write
operations, or advanced further by chaining the `entry` method.

## Signature

```rust
pub trait StoragePathEntry
```



## Examples

```rust
use starknet::ContractAddress;
use starknet::storage::{Map, StoragePathEntry};

#[storage]
struct Storage {
    balances: Map,
}

// Get the storage path for the balance of a specific address
let balance_path = self.balances.entry(address);
```
