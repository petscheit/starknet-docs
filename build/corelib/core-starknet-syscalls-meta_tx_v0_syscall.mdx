title: "core::starknet::syscalls::meta_tx_v0_syscall"
---

Invokes the given entry point as a v0 meta transaction.
- The signature is replaced with the given signature.
- The caller is the OS (address 0).
- The transaction version is replaced by 0.
- The transaction hash is replaced by the corresponding version-0 transaction hash.

The changes apply to the called contract and the inner contracts it calls.
NOTE: This syscall should only be used to allow support for old version-0 bound accounts,
and should not be used for other purposes.



## Signature

```rust
pub extern fn meta_tx_v0_syscall(address: ContractAddress, entry_point_selector: felt252, calldata: Span, signature: Span) -> Result, Array> implicits(GasBuiltin, System) nopanic;
```
