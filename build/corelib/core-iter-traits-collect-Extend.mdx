title: "core::iter::traits::collect::Extend"
---

Extend a collection with the contents of an iterator.
Iterators produce a series of values, and collections can also be thought
of as a series of values. The `Extend` trait bridges this gap, allowing you
to extend a collection by including the contents of that iterator. When
extending a collection with an already existing key, that entry is updated
or, in the case of collections that permit multiple entries with equal
keys, that entry is inserted.

## Signature

```rust
pub trait Extend
```



## Examples

Basic usage:
```rust
let mut arr = array![1, 2];

arr.extend(array![3, 4, 5]);

assert_eq!(arr, array![1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```
