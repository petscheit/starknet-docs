title: "core::starknet::storage::ValidStorageTypeTrait"
---

Trait that ensures a type is valid for storage in Starknet contracts.
This trait is used to enforce that only specific types, such as those implementing
`Store` or acting as a `StorageNode`, can be a part of a storage hierarchy. Any type
that does not implement this trait cannot be used in a storage struct.



## Signature

```rust
pub trait ValidStorageTypeTrait
```
