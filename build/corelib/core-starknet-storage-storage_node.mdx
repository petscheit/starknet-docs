Storage nodes provide a way to structure contract storage data, reflecting their structure in
the storage address computation of their members. They are special structs that can contain any
storable type and are marked with the `#[starknet::storage_node]` attribute.
# Purpose and Benefits

Storage nodes provide a flexible way to structure storage data by allowing non-sequential
storage layouts. They allow the creation of storage-only types, that can contain both
storage-specific types (like `Map` and `Vec`) and regular types - so long as these types are
storable.
Storage nodes are particularly valuable when defining structs containing phantom types like
`Map` and `Vec`. When a struct is marked with `#[starknet::storage_node]`, it automatically
becomes a phantom type.
While you can declare any struct as a storage node (even those without phantom types), doing so
will make that struct a phantom type. For structs that don't contain phantom types, it's often
more appropriate to make them storable using `#[derive(Store)]`. This alternative approach
still enables access to individual struct members through `SubPointers` without imposing the
phantom type behavior.
The storage layout differs significantly between these two approaches:
- `#[derive(Store)]`: Members are stored continuously in the same variable space, with a limit
of 256 field elements.
- Storage node: Each member is stored at a different location. For a storage node member `m`
within a storage variable `variable_name`, the path to that member is computed as
`h(sn_keccak(variable_name), sn_keccak(m))`, where `h` is the Pedersen hash.
## Examples

Here's how to define a storage node:
```rust
#[starknet::storage_node]
struct MyStruct {
   a: felt252,
   b: Map,
}
```

For the struct above, the following storage node struct and impl will be generated:
```rust
struct MyStructStorageNode {
    a: PendingStoragePath,
    b: PendingStoragePath>,
}

impl MyStructStorageNodeImpl of StorageNode {
   fn storage_node(self: StoragePath) -> MyStructStorageNode {
        MyStructStorageNode {
           a: PendingStoragePathTrait::new(@self, selector!("a")),
           b: PendingStoragePathTrait::new(@self, selector!("b")),
        }
   }
}
```

For a type `T` that implements `StorageNode` (e.g. `MyStruct` in the example above),
`Deref>` is implemented as simply calling `storage_node`, and thus exposing the
members of the storage node (`a` and `b` in the example above).
For example, given the following storage:
```rust
#[storage]
struct Storage {
    my_struct: MyStruct,
    a: felt252,
}

We can access the members of the storage node as follows:

```rust
fn use_storage(self: @ContractState) {
    let a_value = self.a.read();
    let inner_a_value = self.my_struct.a.read();
    let b_value = self.my_struct.b.entry(42).read();
}
```

# Flattening Storage Nodes

Storage Nodes members can be annotated with `#[flat]` to flatten the storage hierarchy and not
use the member name in the computation of the storage address for its fields.

```

#storage
struct Storage {
#flat
my_struct: MyStruct,
a: felt252,
}
```rust

When flattened, the storage node's field name (e.g., `my_struct`) doesn't affect storage address
computation. In the example above, both `self.a` and `self.my_struct.a` will point to the same
address. Use `#[flat]` with caution as this behavior is rarely intended.

# Performance Considerations

Storage node members are implemented as `PendingStoragePath` instances, enabling lazy evaluation
of storage paths. This means storage addresses are only computed for members that are actually
accessed.
```
