Range and iteration utilities.
This module provides functionality for creating and iterating over ranges of values.
A range represents an interval of values from a start point to an end point.
# Range Operator Forms

There is currently only a single range operator form: `start..end`, representing a range from
`start` (inclusive) to `end` (exclusive).



## [Structs](./core-ops-range-structs)

| | |
|:---|:---|
| [Range](./core-ops-range-Range) | A (half-open) range bounded inclusively below and exclusively above ( `start..end` ). The range `start..end`  contains all values with `start = end` .... |
| [RangeInclusive](./core-ops-range-RangeInclusive) | Represents the range start, end . |
| [RangeInclusiveIterator](./core-ops-range-RangeInclusiveIterator) | — |
| [RangeIterator](./core-ops-range-RangeIterator) | Represents an iterator located at `cur` , whose end is `end`  ( `cur <= end` ). |
