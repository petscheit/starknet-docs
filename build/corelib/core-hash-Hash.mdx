title: "core::hash::Hash"
---

A trait for values that can be hashed.
This trait should be implemented for any type that can be included in a hash calculation.
The most common way to implement this trait is by using `#[derive(Hash)]`.



## Signature

```rust
pub trait Hash>
```



## Trait functions

### update_state



Updates the hash state with the given value and returns a new hash state.

#### Signature

```rust
fn update_state, T, S, +HashStateTrait>(state: S, value: T) -> S
```




#### Examples

```rust
use core::pedersen::PedersenTrait;
use core::hash::Hash;

let mut state = PedersenTrait::new(0);
let new_state = Hash::update_state(state, 1);
```
