title: "core::clone::Clone"
---

A common trait for the ability to explicitly duplicate an object.
Differs from `Copy` in that `Copy` is implicit and inexpensive, while
`Clone` is always explicit and may or may not be expensive.
Since `Clone` is more general than `Copy`, you can automatically make anything
`Copy` be `Clone` as well.


## Signature

```rust
pub trait Clone
```



## Derivable

This trait can be used with `#[derive]` if all fields are `Clone`. The `derive`d
implementation of `Clone` calls `clone` on each field.

## Trait functions

### clone



Returns a copy of the value.

#### Signature

```rust
fn clone(self: @T) -> T
```




#### Examples

```rust
let arr = array![1, 2, 3];
assert!(arr == arr.clone());
```
