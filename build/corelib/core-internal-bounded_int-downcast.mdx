title: "core::internal::bounded_int::downcast"
---

Downcasts `FromType` to `ToType` - for types where conversion may fail.
If done for wrong types would cause a compiler panic at the Sierra stage.



## Signature

```rust
pub extern fn downcast(x: FromType) -> Option implicits(RangeCheck) nopanic;
```
