title: "core::num::traits::ops::widesquare::WideSquare"
---

A trait for a type that can be squared to produce a wider type.
This trait enables squaring operations where the result type has double
the bit width of the input type, preventing overflow in cases where the
result would exceed the input type's maximum value.

## Signature

```rust
pub trait WideSquare
```



## Examples

```rust
use core::num::traits::WideSquare;

let a: u8 = 16;
let result: u16 = a.wide_square();
assert!(result == 256);
```


## Trait functions

### wide_square



Calculates the square, producing a wider type.





#### Signature

```rust
fn wide_square(self: T) -> WideSquareTarget
```


## Trait types

### Target

The type of the result of the square.


#### Signature

```rust
type Target;
```
