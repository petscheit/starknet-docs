title: "core::starknet::storage::map::Map"
---

A persistent key-value store in contract storage.
This type cannot be instantiated as it is marked with `#[phantom]`. This is by design:
`Map` is a compile-time type that only exists to provide type information for the compiler.
It represents a mapping in storage, but the actual storage operations are handled by the
[`StorageMapReadAccess`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StorageMapReadAccess), [`StorageMapWriteAccess`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StorageMapWriteAccess), and [`StoragePathEntry`](./core-starknet-storage-map-StoragePathEntry) traits.



## Signature

```rust

#[phantom]
pub struct Map {}
```
