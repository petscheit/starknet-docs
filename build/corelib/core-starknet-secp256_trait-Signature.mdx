title: "core::starknet::secp256_trait::Signature"
---

Represents a Secp256{k/r}1 ECDSA signature.
This struct holds the components of an ECDSA signature: `r`, `s`, and `y_parity`.



## Signature

```rust

#[derive(Copy, Drop, Debug, PartialEq, Serde, Hash)]
pub struct Signature {
    pub r: u256,
    pub s: u256,
    pub y_parity: bool,
}
```


## Members

### r


#### Signature

```rust
pub r: u256
```


### s


#### Signature

```rust
pub s: u256
```


### y_parity

The parity of the y coordinate of the elliptic curve point whose x coordinate is `r`.
`y_parity == true` means that the y coordinate is odd.
Some places use non boolean `v` instead of `y_parity`.
In that case, `signature_from_vrs` should be used.


#### Signature

```rust
pub y_parity: bool
```
