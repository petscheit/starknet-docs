title: "core::traits::Not"
---

The unary logical negation operator `!`.

## Signature

```rust
pub trait Not
```



## Examples

An implementation of `Not` for `Answer`, which enables the use of `!` to
invert its value.
```rust
#[derive(Drop, PartialEq)]
enum Answer {
    Yes,
    No,
}

impl AnswerNot of Not {
    fn not(a: Answer) -> Answer {
        match a {
            Answer::Yes => Answer::No,
            Answer::No => Answer::Yes,
        }
    }
}

assert!(!Answer::Yes == Answer::No);
assert!(!Answer::No == Answer::Yes);
```
