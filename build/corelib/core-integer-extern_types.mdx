| [u128](./core-integer-u128) | The 128-bit unsigned integer type. |
| [U128MulGuarantee](./core-integer-U128MulGuarantee) | A type that contains 4 u128s (a, b, c, d) and guarantees that `a * b = 2**128 * c + d` . The guarantee is verified by `u128_mul_guarantee_verify` , which is the only way to destruct this... |
