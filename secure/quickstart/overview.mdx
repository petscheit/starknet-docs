## Introduction

Welcome to the official *Help secure Starknet* guide! üõ°Ô∏è

This comprehensive tutorial will walk you through the entire process of becoming a Starknet validator, from meeting the prerequisites to successfully running your validator node. While Starknet is currently still centralized, it is gradually moving towards employing a staking protocol, handing over the responsibilities of producing, attesting, and proving blocks to validators.

By the end of this guide, you'll have hands-on experience with the core tools and processes needed to participate in Starknet's decentralized validation network.

## What you'll learn

This guide is structured as a series of interconnected tutorials that build upon each other:

* [Running a full node](/secure/quickstart/running-a-node) - Setting up and maintaining your validator node

* [Becoming a validator](/secure/quickstart/becoming-a-validator) - How to stake your tokens to become eligible for validation

* [Attesting to blocks](/secure/quickstart/attesting-to-blocks) - Learn how to participate in block attestation as a validator

* [Recommended next steps](/secure/quickstart/next-steps) - Advanced topics and ongoing maintenance
