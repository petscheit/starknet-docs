title: "Setting up your environment"

Let's first set up a Rust project with S-two.

```bash
$ cargo new stwo-example
```
We need to specify the nightly Rust compiler to use S-two.

```bash
$ echo -e "[toolchain]\nchannel = \"nightly-2025-01-02\"" > rust-toolchain.toml
```
Now let's edit the `Cargo.toml` file as follows:

```toml
[package]
name = "stwo-examples"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
license = "MIT"

[dependencies]
stwo-prover = { git = "https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo.git", rev = "92984c060b49d0db05e021883755fac0a71a2fa7" }
num-traits = "0.2.17"
itertools = "0.12.0"
rand = "0.8.5"
```

We are all set!
