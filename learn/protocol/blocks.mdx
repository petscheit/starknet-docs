## Overview

A Starknet block is a list of transactions and a block header that contains [multiple fields](/learn/protocol/blocks#block-header-fields), including the [hash of the previous block](/learn/protocol/blocks#block-hash) and a [commitment to their state diff](/learn/protocol/blocks#state-diff-commitment), as well as [commitments to the transactions, events, and receipts](/learn/protocol/blocks#transactions%2C-events%2C-and-receipts-commitments) it includes.

## Block hash

A block hash is defined by:

```
h(
    "STARKNET_BLOCK_HASH1",
    block_number,
    global_state_root,
    sequencer_address,
    block_timestamp,
    transaction_count || event_count || state_diff_length || l1_da_mode,
    state_diff_commitment,
    transactions_commitment
    events_commitment,
    receipts_commitment,
    gas_prices_hash,
    protocol_version,
    0,
    parent_block_hash
)
```

Where:

* `h` is the [Poseidon hash function](/learn/protocol/cryptography#poseidon-hash)

* `transaction_count || event_count || state_diff_length || l1_da_mode` is the concatenation of the 64-bit representations of `transaction_count`, `event_count`, and `state_diff_length` with 0 if `l1_da_mode` is `CALLDATA` and 1 if `l1_da_mode` is `BLOB`

* `gas_prices_hash` is defined by:

  ```
  h(
      "STARKNET_GAS_PRICES0",
      l1_gas_price_wei,
      l1_gas_price_fri,
      l1_data_gas_price_wei,
      l1_data_gas_price_fri,
      l2_gas_price_wei,
      l2_gas_price_fri
  )
  ```

  where `h` is the [Poseidon hash function](/learn/protocol/cryptography#poseidon-hash) and `l1_gas_price_wei`, `l1_gas_price_fri`, `l1_data_gas_price_wei`, `l1_data_gas_price_fri`, `l2_gas_price_wei`, and `l2_gas_price_fri` are the wei and fri denominated prices for the three resource types.

## State diff commitment

The state diff commitment is defined by:

```
h(
    "STARKNET_STATE_DIFF0",
    s + r,
    deployed_address1, deployed_class_hash1, ... , deployed_addresss, deployed_class_hashs,
    replaced_contract_address1, new_class_hash1, ... , replaced_contract_addressr, new_class_hashr,
    d,
    declared_class_hash1, declared_compiled_class_hash1, ... , declared_class_hashd, declared_compiled_class_hashd,
    1,
    0,
    n,
    c1, k1,1, v1,1, ... ,k1,m1, v1,m1, ... ,cn, kn,1, vn,1, ... ,kn,mn, vn,mn,
    k,
    account1, new_nonce1, ... ,accountk, new_noncek
)
```

Where:

* `h` is the Poseidon hash function

* `1` and `0` are placeholders that may be used in the future

* `ci,ki,1, vi,1, … , ki,mi,vi,mi` are `mi` updates `(ki,1, vi,1), … ,(ki,mi, vi,mi)` to contract addresses `ci`

## Transactions, events, and receipts commitments

The commitment to transactions, the commitment to events and the commitment to receipts are all roots of height-64 binary Merkle Patricia tries where the leaf at index `i` corresponds to:

* For transactions: `h(transaction_hash, signature)` for the `i`'th transaction included in the block, where `h` is the [Poseidon hash function](/learn/protocol/cryptography#poseidon-hash). Note that the signature is itself a (possibly empty) array of field elements.

* For events: The [event hash](/learn/protocol/blocks#event-hash) of the `i`'th emitted event included in the block

* For receipts: The [receipt hash](/learn/protocol/blocks#receipt-hash) of the `i`'th transaction receipt included in the block

### Event hash

The hash of an [event](https://book.cairo-lang.org/ch101-03-contract-events.html) emitted by a contract whose address is `emitter_address` and a transaction whose hash is `tx_hash` is defined by:

```
h(
    emitter_address,
    tx_hash,
    h(keys),
    h(data)
)
```

Where `h` is the [Poseidon hash function](/learn/protocol/cryptography#poseidon-hash).

### Receipt hash

The hash of a [transaction receipt](/learn/protocol/transactions#transaction-receipt) is defined by:

```
h(
    transaction_hash,
    actual_fee,
    h(messages),
    sn_keccak(revert_reason),
    h(l2_gas_consumed, l1_gas_consumed, l1_data_gas_consumed)
)
```

Where:

* `h` is the [Poseidon hash function](/learn/protocol/cryptography#poseidon-hash)

* `h(messages)` for `messages = (from1, to1, payload1), … , (fromn, ton, payloadn)` is defined by:

  ```
  h(
      n,
      from1, to1, h(len(payload1) || payload1), ... , fromn, ton, h(len(payloadn) || payloadn)
  )
  ```
